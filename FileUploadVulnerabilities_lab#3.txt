	goal path : /home/carlos/secret
	current path : /files/avatars
	some sites prevents running scripts in the directories that recieves user-supplied files, so we upload the exp file in diffrent directory to can run it. 
	the current path(that recieves user-supplied files): /files/avatars
	so we back to the previos folder(files), then run the file


1.application is a vulnerable with image upload 
2.create php file(webShell.php) and write to it the code that get the asked path(/home/carlos/secret)
	webShell.php: <?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>
3.open burp proxy >> intercept on , then iupload file.php >> send the request to repeater
4.
5.go to repeater, in the request msg change filename from webShell.php to ../webShell.php. 
6.send the request. msg shows in the response: "the file avatars/webShell.php has been uploaded." This Implies that the server is stripping the directory traversal sequence from the file name.

7.apply url encoding on (../) ==> %2e%2e%2f, so filename=%2e%2e%2fwebShell.php then send the request. in the respnse, msg shows: "The file avatars/../webShell.php has been uploaded." this means that the file already uploaded in the files directory
8.go to home page to refresh its result. go to the http hestory, then check response of the GET files/webShell.php ==> the sercret shows
9. submit the secret in the lab banner
